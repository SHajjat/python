# there is another data type called complex

complex =10 # its usually used in complicated equations its like imaginary number

# bin() changes to binary numbers

print(bin(10000)) # this will print 0b10011100010000

print(int("0b10011100010000",2))  # im telling it i have number to the base of 2 i wanna change to int
# this will return it to integer 10000
